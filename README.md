# Social Media Management System

**Social Media Management System** is an application designed to centralize and simplify content management for social media, offering an integrated set of features ranging from scheduling and publishing posts to managing multimedia files and utilizing artificial intelligence for text and content generation.

## Project Description

This management system was created with the goal of unifying multiple tools into a single interface, eliminating the need to switch between platforms. The application allows you to:
- Schedule and program posts on various social media platforms in a coordinated manner.
- Manage and synchronize files and media through integration with Nextcloud.
- Leverage ChatGPT’s capabilities to generate text suggestions and automatically create content, thereby improving engagement and communication quality.

Combining these functionalities optimizes workflow and ensures a more efficient and consistent social media presence.

## Main Features

- **Social Content Management:**  
  Organize your posting calendar, manage publications, and gain a comprehensive overview of social media activities.

- **Nextcloud Integration:**  
  Synchronize content files (images, videos, documents) with your Nextcloud server, enabling secure and centralized media management and sharing.

- **AI Support with ChatGPT:**  
  Use ChatGPT’s APIs to assist with text creation, suggest edits, and enhance communication with automatically generated content based on customized input and parameters.

- **Customizable Configuration:**  
  Configuration files included in the project allow you to set the necessary values for connecting to Nextcloud and ChatGPT APIs. This flexibility enables the application to be adapted to the specific needs of each user or work environment.

## Configuration Instructions

To ensure proper functionality of the integrations, you need to customize certain configuration files within the project. Specifically:

- **Nextcloud Settings:**  
  In the dedicated configuration files, insert your Nextcloud server URL, access credentials (username, password, or token), and any other required parameters. These settings are essential for enabling automatic file synchronization and management of multimedia content.

- **ChatGPT Settings:**  
  In the API configuration files, specify the API key provided by OpenAI and, if necessary, configure additional parameters related to the AI’s operation. Be sure to consult OpenAI’s documentation to fully leverage the functionalities offered by ChatGPT.

> **Note:** The values currently present in the configuration files are examples and must be replaced with real values according to your operational requirements and the information provided by the respective services.

## Benefits of Using the Management System

- **Process Centralization:**  
  All operations related to content management, synchronization, and creation are carried out from a single interface, reducing time and complexity.

- **Intelligent Automation:**  
  Integration with ChatGPT enables the automation of text generation, offering creative insights and reducing manual workload.

- **Flexibility and Customization:**  
  The ability to configure Nextcloud and ChatGPT settings separately allows the application to be tailored to various environments and specific requirements.

- **Efficient Media Management:**  
  File synchronization via Nextcloud ensures that all necessary media is always updated and available, facilitating content scheduling and publication.

## Future Implementations

The project is continuously evolving, and further integrations are planned to expand its capabilities:

- **WhatsApp API for Notifications:**  
  An integration with WhatsApp’s API will be implemented to automatically send notifications to clients whenever new content is published, improving communication and engagement.

- **META Business API for Automatic Scheduling:**  
  A feature will be introduced to directly schedule posts on META Business. This will allow for posts to be automatically uploaded and scheduled once approved by the client, eliminating the need for manual re-uploading.
